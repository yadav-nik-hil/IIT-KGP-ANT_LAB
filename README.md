Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations have been solved using Numerical Techniques.

ODE - 
For linear ODE -> TDMA and Block TDMA.
For Non-Linear ODE -> Newton Linearisation Technique, Quasi Linearisation Technique.

PDE - 
Methods like Alternating Direction Implicit Scheme, Implicit Method, Explicit Method, Crank Nicolson Scheme, Gauss Seidel.
For Non-Linear PDE, Newton Linearisation is used with the Crank Nicolson Scheme.


Instructions:
In every code, a specific example has been solved using a particular scheme/method.
To solve a new example, reset the values and matrices by manually deriving the recurrence relations.
Also, put the boundary conditions.
The choice of the initial value is required in methods like Newton's Linearization Technique which should be carefully chosen, as it can lead to converging/diverging solutions.

Bonus:
The codes contain the graphical plotting so the visualisation becomes easy. Change the Boundary values and grid size to see the effects.


Any changes are welcome.
